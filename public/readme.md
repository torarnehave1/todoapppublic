*** A Index.html file for the project ***

The document starts with the necessary HTML structure, including the <!doctype html> declaration and <html> tag with a language attribute set to English.

The <head> section contains metadata, including character encoding, viewport settings, and links to external stylesheets. It also includes a script tag that imports the Papa Parse library, which is used for parsing CSV files.

A title is set for the document: "AlivenessLAB ideas".

The <body> of the document contains a button with the id "importBtn" and a text "Import CSV".

There's a <div> with the id "container" that wraps the main content of the page.

Inside the container, there's a form with a text input and a submit button. The form doesn't have a specified action or method, so by default, it will send a GET request to the current URL.

There's also a "Select All" checkbox with the id "selectAll" and a corresponding label. The span element with the class "material-symbols-outlined" is likely used for displaying an icon.

The tasks list is in a <div> with the id "tasks-list".

Finally, there's a script tag that imports a JavaScript module from "/main.js".

In summary, this code sets up a basic HTML document with a form and a tasks list, and it includes a button for importing CSV files. The actual functionality for handling form submissions and CSV imports would be implemented in the "/main.js" file.The script in the HTML file uses the Papa Parse library to parse the CSV files when they are imported.

*** For B (CSV File Upload):

Component B outlines the CSV file upload functionality within the application. It utilizes the Papa Parse library for parsing CSV files, which is included in the Index.html via a <script> tag: <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/PapaParse/5.3.0/papaparse.min.js"></script>. This script enables the application to read and parse CSV files directly in the browser, facilitating the efficient processing of user-uploaded CSV data. Once parsed, this data is prepared for upload to the Appwrite.io database, demonstrating a direct application of Papa Parse for data handling and manipulation in the web environment."
This expanded description explicitly connects the inclusion of the Papa Parse library in the Index.html file to its critical role in CSV file processing and highlights its importance in the application's data management workflow.
